# ⚡ Full Tech Stack & Justifications

| Layer          | Tech Choice                            | Why This?                                                 | Alternatives (Why Not?)                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**   | React (Vite setup)                     | Fast, modern, component-based UI                          | Angular is heavy, plain HTML outdated     |
| **Backend**    | Flask (Python API)                     | Lightweight, Python synergy, easy AI integration          | Node.js good, but AI in Python simpler    |
| **Database**   | SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)       | SQLite simple for dev, PostgreSQL scalable for deployment | MongoDB only if schema is highly flexible |
| **AI/NLP**     | spaCy (text), OpenCV (optional images) | Easy to integrate NLP with Flask                          | Advanced ML overkill for MVP/demo         |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (frontend), Render (backend+DB) | Free, scalable, ideal for student/demo apps               | Heroku limited free tier now              |
| **Maps/Geo**   | React-Leaflet + OpenStreetMap          | Free, interactive, marker customization supported         | Google Maps API requires billing setup    |

# 🔄 Local Development Workflow

## 1️⃣ Frontend (React Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm create vite@latest .
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs on `http://localhost:3000`

## 2️⃣ Backend (Flask)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install flask flask-cors sqlalchemy spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python app.py
```

Runs on `http://localhost:5000`

## 3️⃣ Communication Flow

- React sends API calls via Axios/Fetch to Flask (`http://localhost:5000`)
- Flask processes, interacts with SQLite DB, returns JSON responses
- CORS enabled in Flask for cross-origin access
- Locations with coordinates fetched from DB and shown as map pins with image previews and animated cards

# 🗺️ Map Features & Interactive Ideas

**LostConnect Map UI will include:**

1. **Animated Pin Cards (Mac-style):** Click pins to reveal smooth animated cards with item photo, type, description, and 'View Details' button.
2. **Cluster Nearby Pins:** Automatically group close markers to keep map clean; expands on zoom.
3. **Category-Based Pin Colors:** Different pin icons/colors for Lost vs Found items for instant visual distinction.
4. **Sidebar with Search & Filters:** Floating sidebar to filter items by type, time range, or keyword search.
5. **Map Dark Mode Toggle:** User can switch map appearance between light/dark themes.
6. **User Location Detection:** Auto-center map to user's device location and mark "You Are Here".
7. **Toast Notifications:** After submitting reports or successful actions, display sleek toast messages.

All features designed for responsive, mobile-friendly experience.
