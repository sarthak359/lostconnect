# ⚡ Full Tech Stack & Justifications

| Layer          | Tech Choice                            | Why This?                                            | Alternatives (Why Not?)                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**   | React (Vite setup)                     | Fast, modern, component-based UI                     | Angular is heavy, plain HTML outdated  |
| **Backend**    | Flask (Python API)                     | Lightweight, Python synergy, easy AI integration     | Node.js good, but AI in Python simpler |
| **Database**   | Cloud PostgreSQL (Render)              | Consistent dev & prod DB, scalable, no local install | SQLite only for basic prototypes       |
| **AI/NLP**     | spaCy (text), OpenCV (optional images) | Easy to integrate NLP with Flask                     | Advanced ML overkill for MVP/demo      |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (frontend), Render (backend+DB) | Free, scalable, ideal for student/demo apps          | Heroku limited free tier now           |
| **Maps/Geo**   | React-Leaflet + OpenStreetMap          | Free, interactive, marker customization supported    | Google Maps API requires billing setup |

# 🔄 Local Development Workflow

## 1️⃣ Frontend (React Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm create vite@latest .
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs on `http://localhost:3000`

## 2️⃣ Backend (Flask with Cloud PostgreSQL)

- Sign up for [Render](https://render.com)
- Create a free PostgreSQL instance
- Copy the connection string provided, example:

```
postgresql://username:password@your-db-host.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/yourdbname
```

- Update `app.py` configuration:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_cors import CORS

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'your_render_connection_string_here'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

- Run backend:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install flask flask-cors flask-sqlalchemy spacy psycopg2-binary
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python app.py
```

Runs on `http://localhost:5000`

✅ Cloud PostgreSQL used for both local development and production.

---

# 3️⃣ Communication Flow

- React sends API calls via Axios/Fetch to Flask (`http://localhost:5000`)
- Flask processes, interacts with Render-hosted PostgreSQL, returns JSON responses
- CORS enabled in Flask for cross-origin access
- Locations with coordinates fetched from DB and shown as map pins with image previews and animated cards

# 🗺️ Map Features & Interactive Ideas

**LostConnect Map UI will include:**

1. **Animated Pin Cards (Mac-style):** Click pins to reveal smooth animated cards with item photo, type, description, and 'View Details' button.
2. **Cluster Nearby Pins:** Automatically group close markers to keep map clean; expands on zoom.
3. **Category-Based Pin Colors:** Different pin icons/colors for Lost vs Found items for instant visual distinction.
4. **Sidebar with Search & Filters:** Floating sidebar to filter items by type, time range, or keyword search.
5. **Map Dark Mode Toggle:** User can switch map appearance between light/dark themes.
6. **User Location Detection:** Auto-center map to user's device location and mark "You Are Here".
7. **Toast Notifications:** After submitting reports or successful actions, display sleek toast messages.

All features designed for responsive, mobile-friendly experience.

- Sign up on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Connect your GitHub repo
- Vercel auto-builds & deploys React project
- Public URL provided instantly

## ✅ Backend & DB Deployment (Render)

- Backend already configured to use Render's PostgreSQL (same for dev & prod)
- Create a new Render Web Service for Flask backend:
  - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Start Command: `python app.py`
- Update frontend API calls to use Render's backend URL in production
